## Laser Shielding
The laser shielding material is an transparent orange plastic which I believe to be acrylic.  
The laser wavelength is 445nm (blue).  Orange filters blue light eliminating most of the optical power.

It was ordered from [J-Tech Photonics](https://jtechphotonics.com/?product=445nm-laser-shielding).

## Threaded Inserts
M3 brass threaded inserts.  Purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2RWRW4/).
